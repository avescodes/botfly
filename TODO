Botfly Todo List (by priority)
==============================
* Replace CommonBlockAcceptor responder chain array with ResponderChain object
** Spec & create ResponderChain class
** Have responder chain stop call first responder ONLY after reaching a match
** Additionally provide DSL for on... chain to give priority to responders (that is to say one can specify which responders fire first)
* Finish speccing matchers, responders
* More robust instance methods on responders (i.e. provide access to variables through methods and not ivars)
* Additional matchers on single and multi-user chat (not sure what, but doesn't feel complete)
* Add configure method to accept list of configuration paramaters.
* Support any of a bevy of features provided by xmpp4r
